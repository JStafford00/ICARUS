ICARUS (Item Catalog and Repository User Software) is an open source project that aims to build a fully functional item catalog applicaion that would be use in a retail enviroment. The main purpose of this project is to sharpen my own C# coding skills by building an application that would be used in todays world. If the project interests you, then feel free to fork it and make any changes you would like to it. I just ask give me credit as the original author.
